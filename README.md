# Uccallus
The official GitHub repository of Uccallus - CMPM 171 Winter 2015.
Created by Get A Clu Games

HOW TO UPLOAD TO GIT:

To upload the code, download the Github application for Windows (Mac if you have a Mac). You can find the link for it if you just google "Github for Windows/Mac".

After downloading the app, open it up! It takes a while to load, so don't freak out if it's been 5 minutes and it still won't open. It'll give you some steps to do, like linking your Git account and blah blah.

Then, click on the glowing blue + on the top left corner. Select Clone and click on dnreyes/Uccallus. It'll ask you where to save it. Save it anywhere, but usually, it's easier to find it on it's default. (Documents->Github)

Once cloned, you'll be able to see the recent version of the code/app. You can access and open the app by going to where you saved the repository (see above). You can also add your own code and app by moving/copying your version of the app to the same place.

Once you copy your version of the app to where you saved the repository, go back to the Git app on your desktop and it should already register the changes you made, under Uncommited Changes. There, you write a title for your changes and once you finish, it should say Commit!

Then click on Sync (button on the top right corner that is also glowing).

Then you're done! (Hopefully)
